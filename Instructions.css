* Put all of this code inside a folder named `week1-day2-html-css`, and put the folder in a place where you normally code. \
* Use the command line to make a folder called `css`.\
* Use the command line to make a file called `style.css` inside of thee `css` folder.\
* Reference the `style.css` in your `student-bio.html` file. You do this by placing `<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/style.css">` inside the `<head>` tag.\
* Style the example on the projector.\
  * Add a `class` called "container" on the `div` tag.\
  * Add an `id` called "main-bio" for the first `section` tag.\
  * Add an `id` called "contact-info" for the second `section` tag.\
  * Add an `id` called "bio-image" for the bio image.\
* Style specs:\
\
  * `body`\
    * The background color is `#efeee7`.\
    * The font used `"Georgia",Times New Roman,Times,serif;`.\
    * The font color is `#333333`.\
    * Be sure to zero out the body margins and padding so the page is flush to the top of the page:\
      ```css\
      body \{\
        margin: 0;\
        padding: 0;\
      \}\
      ```\

    * The background color is `#333333`.\
  * `h1`\
    * The font color is `#eee`.\
    * The font size is `28px`.\
    * Look at the example on the screen, and eyeball the padding and/or margins and positioning of the text.\
  * `h2`\
    * The font size is `24px`\
  * Make the container have a width of 1024 pixels, and center it. You do this using `margin: 0 auto;`.\
  * Make `#main-bio`, `#contact-info`, `#bio-image` all `float: left`.\
  * Make the `#bio-image` have a width of 200 pixels.\
  * Be sure to include `alt` text in all images\
  * `#main-bio` should have a width of `70%`.\
    * Add margins to the image so there is distance between it and the bio text.\
  * `#contact-info` should have a width of `30%`.\
  * Adjust the line height so it is 1.5 times the size of the font.\
  * Make the link color `#d21034`.\
\
* If you forgot how to write the CSS properties, you can reference all CSS properties here <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference>\
